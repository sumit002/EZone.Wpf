# EZone.Wpf Product
Electronic Zone - eZone (WPF-MVVM): A place/store to find all your business strategies you crave.
This repo contains the samples that demonstrate the Business usage and popular features for the Windows Presentation Foundation in the .NET Framework for Desktop. These samples were initially hosted on Localhost, and we are gradually 
moving all the eZone samples over to GitHub. All the samples have been retargeted to [.NET 4.6.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework-runtime/net461).

Please note that the documentation on the repo is still being updated, so all links might not point to the right location.

## Using the samples

To use the application with Git, clone the EZone repository with 'git clone https://github.com/sumit002/EZone.Wpf'

After cloning the EZone respository, there will be one solution file in the root directory: ElectronicZone.Wpf.sln (targeting .NET Framework 4.6.1).

* To build the samples, open one of the solution files in Visual Studio 2017 Community and build the solution. 

The easiest way to use these samples without using Git is to download the zip file containing the current version (using the link below or by clicking the "Download ZIP" button on the repo page). You can then unzip the entire archive and use the application in Visual Studio 2017.

   **Notes:** 
   * Before you unzip the archive, right-click it, select Properties, and then select Unblock.
   * Most modules should work independently
   * By default, all the .NET Framework samples target .NET 4.6.1, you can change this in the Project->Properties page in Visual Studio.
